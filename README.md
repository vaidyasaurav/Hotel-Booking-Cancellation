Analyzing Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Excel

### Project Overview:

This project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations using data analysis techniques and Excel. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to cancellations, ultimately providing insights that can help hotels reduce their cancellation rates and improve customer satisfaction.

### Objectives:

- Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather data on hotel bookings, including cancellations, from various sources. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Excel to perform EDA, identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
- Identify Key Factors: Analyze the data to determine the key factors influencing booking cancellations, such as booking lead time, customer demographics, booking channels, and seasonal trends.
- Visualization: Create visual representations of the data, such as charts and graphs, to illustrate the findings.
- Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations for hotel management to reduce cancellation rates.
  
### Tools and Technologies:
